# ROM Launcher

**ROM Launcher** is a minimal Electron desktop app to launch emulators with basic arguments (yes, *minimal* and *electron* in one sentence, I know). It's compatible with *pretty much* every emulator that supports command-line arguments. 

### Download
[Download version 1.2 (Win x64) here](https://github.com/ButcheredGenre/ROMLauncher/releases/tag/1.2)

NEW: ROM Launcher v.1.2! Version 1.2 adds optional subfolder search and experimental controller support, amongst a number of smaller fixes and additions.


### Installation & Help
ROM Launcher is portable and cannot be installed - just drop the /ROMLauncher/ folder in some appropriate directory. For help and basic reference, read through 'readme.txt' in the /readme/ directory.

### Linux Release
I can't properly test ROM Launcher on other systems, so I won't *officially* release it for other operating systems (I hope this figures). Since ROM Launcher runs in Electron, you can download the [appropriate Electron binaries for your system](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases) and run the application that way (drop the /app/ folder into the /electron/resources/ folder -- make sure the Electron folder is placed in an empty folder, since ROM Launcher uses that directory as its working directory -- finally place the /icons/ folder into that new parent-directory and you should be good to go -- maybe, that is, I really can't say for sure. If this explanation was a bit confusing, simply look at the Windows release as reference for the folder structure).
