# ROM Launcher

**ROM Launcher** is a minimal Electron desktop app to launch emulators with basic arguments (yes, *minimal* and *electron* in one sentence, I know). It's compatible with *pretty much* every emulator that supports command-line arguments. 

### Download
[Download version 1.2 (Win/Linux x64) here](https://github.com/ButcheredGenre/ROMLauncher/releases/tag/1.2)

NEW: ROM Launcher v.1.2! Version 1.2 adds optional subfolder search and experimental controller support, amongst a number of smaller fixes and additions.

### Installation & Help
ROM Launcher is portable and cannot be installed - just drop the /ROMLauncher/ folder in some appropriate directory. For help and basic reference, read through 'readme.txt' in the /readme/ directory.
